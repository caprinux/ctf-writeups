### Challenge Description

P.S. all spaces in flag should be replaced with a ‚Äú_‚Äù P.S. plane model for eg. A380-800 will become LNC{A380-800}

### Solution

Following the picture, you will be able to find Jia Jun's email.

If you email him, you will get an automated response:

Now if you go to his [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jiajunlnc/), you can see that he has 1 post.

His biography also states: 

```
A happy boi
Bday: 7/3
Creator Note: My name is not actually JiaJun I just put this name cuz why not
```

If you go to his post, you will see ``Just arrived on time for my birthday celebration üòä`` and a picture of the airport.

If you reverse search the picture of the airport,

You will see that it is a picture of an airport in Nairobi, or more specifically, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.

So we know that he flew from Singapore to Nairobi on 7th of March.

The biggest problem with this challenge is finding the correct website that will give historical flight data. 

Most of the websites have a paywall when you try to view historical flight data etc. 

Luckily, we had a resourceful teammate who immediately identified a [website](https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/sq7344) that we could use and managed to find the flight immediately.

However, even though we had the aircraft number, the website wasn't accepting our flag, but after some support tickets to get help with the format of the flag, we managed to get first ü©∏ for OSINT!!
