### Solution

Initially when I was trying this challenge at 8.10am in school, 10 minutes after the wave that this challenge was realeased with came out, there were no attachments and I was just hard stuck wondering what I can decrypt with simply the lines "Oink Oink is the sound I make".

Coming back a few hours later, I see that the challenge was edited and a picture was added.

Oink Oink is the sound that pig makes.

If you google Pig Cipher, you will find that google gave the cipher away.

Going to a [pigpen cipher decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/pigpen-cipher), and copying the characters in the image provided,

We get the flag.

```
LNC{OINKOINKPIGISCUTE}
