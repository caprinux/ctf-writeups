### Solution

We are given a text file with the following: 

```
L3TS_667e24NR1N0b2346fCPN49c1ce26{3EK8dda87}SN_3f43d3b·
```

Following the hints in the challenge description, we searched for [Greek Ciphers](https://interestingengineering.com/11-cryptographic-methods-that-marked-history-from-the-caesar-cipher-to-enigma-code-and-beyond#:~:text=Scytale%20was%20an%20ancient%20form,the%20message%20written%20onto%20it.) and came across scytale which was said to be used by the spartans.

Furthermore, the name of the cipher also managed the clue which says "how the **sky** was formed".

Plugging the cipher text into an [online scytale decoder] and keeping the puncutations and spaces, we get:

```
