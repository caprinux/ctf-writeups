### Challenge Description

Answer not in flag format. Submit in all caps e.g. LNC{FLAG}

I found this in my brother's diary:

My idiot cousin has an emerald lair. Find keys in systems. Those hackers entered by encrypting sensitive tables.

### Solution

No attachments, and only a single line of text. There isn't much we can do with it.

However, the sentence structure was rather off and sounded weird. It seems like it was forced to hide something.

If we take the first letter of every word, we get:

```
Michael Fkis Thebest
```

Placing it into a flag format, we get

```
LNC{Michael_Fkis_Thebest}
```
